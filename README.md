A HTML5 MOBILE APP
FOR LEARNING SPANISH
USING GEOLOCATION & PHONEGAP

Developed in 2013 as part of my thesis in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of MSc in Computer Science
of the School of Computing of the University of Kent, UK.

Learning languages has become a necessity for professional development. A common problem for many adults is that practicing a
foreign language during their spare time can only be possible by either enrolling in language academies, or by going to study abroad on vacation. Still some people who are learning a foreign language cannot
remember all of the vocabulary and phrases taught at class but by learning and usingthem in their context.

The purpose of this app, was to provide a service to these two needs while taking a step further in the development of mobile learning 
language applications. By exploiting the very nature of mobile devices, that is, their location capabilities that provide geolocation
and context awareness, this application customizes the learning experience for those users in other to maximize their learning experience.
